# Spotify Website

Welcome!  

![alt text](https://github.com/sheltoncarr/spotify_app/blob/main/static/images/website_preview.png)  

This repository contains all the code for our [Spotify Music Analysis](https://spotify-app-2pjw8.ondigitalocean.app/) website.  

The purpose of this website is to provide Spotify users with an in-depth analysis of their music taste and listening habits.  

To accomplish this, the website presents the user with their top artists, songs, genres, and years (by release year). It also provides recommendations based on the user's top artists and songs, as well as an audio feature analysis over time. Finally, it ranks the user's top artists by popularity and displays their most recenetly played tracks.  

To use the website, you must be registered as a user. Please feel free to message us if you would like to explore the site (all we need is your name and email)! Note: the website does not store any user data.   

We are currently working to get the website approved for [Extended Quota Mode](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/quota-modes) in order to access a wider audience.   

The website is hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and uses the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) and the [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.1/) Python library.
