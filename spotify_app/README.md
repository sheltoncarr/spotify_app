# Spotify Website

An app using Spotipy and the Spotify API to display user's top songs and artists along with audio analysis and song recommendations.

To use this app, you first need to make a Spotify Developer account (free) at https://developer.spotify.com/

After setting up the account, you will need to collect your Client ID, Client Secret, and Redirect URL (I set my Redirect URL to be https://localhost:8888/callback) and put these in a .env file.

Then you will need to create your virtual environment and install the requirements.txt packages.

Once this is done, navigate to the respository holding the main.py file in your terminal and execute the following command:
`run main.py`
