Ideas:

- fix audio sample button bugs (bug when audio ends, the pause button stays pause, should turn back to play button. also there's a bug if you try to play songs from different tables)
- the "Show Rows" should align together instead of being right aligned
- Don't need the dropdowns for Recommendations since they only show top 10 rows
- Tables are now out of alignment
- Add a button that will add a certain recommended song to a user's music library
- add documentations to each function
- Make visuals for audio analysis, top genres, and top years sections
- Apply for Extended Quota Mode
- For audio features, include loudness, bpm, and duration
- Edege case for currently playing while spotify dj is on
- figure out your data page (playists)
- Clean up code + folders + old files
- Add profile picture to About You page
- Clean up/update requirements.txt
- getting this warning every time we run app.py: "DeprecationWarning: You're using 'as_dict = True'.get_access_token will return the token string directly in future versions. Please adjust your code accordingly, or use get_cached_token instead.
  auth_manager.get_access_token(request.args.get("code"))"
- Fix dropdown menu formatting and remove dropdown menus for tabs that don't need it
