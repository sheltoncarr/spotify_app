Ideas:

- Add a button instead of the hyperlink to the play the song preview, or convert the URL to "Click Here" or something
- Add a button that will add a certain recommended song to a user's music library
- Show song release date --> could then analyze what year had a user's favorite music?
- "Loading" sign when processing 
- add documentations to each function
- Make visuals for audio analysis section
- Apply for Extended Quota Mode
- For audio features, include loudness, bpm, and duration
- Edege case for currently playing while spotify dj is on
- fix contact us page
- figure out your data page (playists)
- Clean up code + folders + old files
- Add profile picture to About You page
- Clean up/update requirements.txt
- getting this warning every time we run app.py: "DeprecationWarning: You're using 'as_dict = True'.get_access_token will return the token string directly in future versions. Please adjust your code accordingly, or use get_cached_token instead.
  auth_manager.get_access_token(request.args.get("code"))"
