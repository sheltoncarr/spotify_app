Ideas:

- Apply for Extended Quota Mode
- For audio features, include loudness, bpm, and duration
- Fix user name bug
- Clean up/update requirements.txt
- getting this warning every time we run app.py: "DeprecationWarning: You're using 'as_dict = True'.get_access_token will return the token string directly in future versions. Please adjust your code accordingly, or use get_cached_token instead.
  auth_manager.get_access_token(request.args.get("code"))"
- Make github repo public once we push the website live
- Don't include "." after month abbreviation for May for Release Date columns
- Delete notes

If we have time: 
- Add hover function over bar charts to display songs/artists represented in the bar
